<h1>Softuni</h1>
<span>Hello. Here on this repository you can find my solutions for the exercises on Softuni Softwear University, writed during my study on different technologist like( C#, JavaScrit, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap) and some small projects.</span>

<h2>C# Basics</h2>
<span>In this course I took the first steps in programming. I learned to work with for loops, while loops, nested loops and conditional operators.</span>
<h2>C# Programming Fundamentals</h2>
<span>In this course I level up my skills in the C# programming language, tooks my first step in OOP programing, learned to: work with some colections (Array, List, Dictionary, nested Dictionary), manipulate string whit regex and other operation like LINQ and loops and inproved my algoritmic thinkings.</span>
<h2>C# Programming Advanced</h2>
<span>In Ð°dvanced programming course I continued to develop my algorithmic thinking and I entered deeper into OOP programming. I learned new type of structures to collect data (Queue, Hashset, Stack, LinkedList, Multidimensional Arrays, JaggedArray). </span>
<h2>JavaScript Programming Advanced</h2>
<span>In this course, I saw how it works dynamically type language. I learned how to use different type collections like (Object, Arrays and Nested Arrays ) on dynamic environment, learned how to manipulate DOM tree, to add event listeners and using them.</span>
<h2>JavaScript Programming Application</h2>
<span>This course teached me what is that asynchronous programming, routing system, view in context of single page application. We builded front end part of SPA application from zero.</span>
