<h1>Softuni</h1>
<span>Hello. Here on this repository you can find my solutions for the exercises on Softuni Softwear University, writed during my study on different technologist( C#, JavaScrit, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap) and some small projects. At the end of each course I had an exam. In this repo you can see my exams preparations, certifications and exams solutions, plus some solutions on problems in HackerRank platform.</span>

<h2>C# Basics</h2>
<span>In this course I took the first steps in programming. I learned to work with for loops, while loops, nested loops and conditional operators.</span>
<h2>C# Programming Fundamentals</h2>
<span>In this course I level up my skills in the C# programming language, tooks my first step in OOP programing, learned to work with some data structures (Array, List, Dictionary, nested Dictionary), manipulate string with regex and other operation like LINQ and loops and improved my algoritmic thinkings.</span>
<h2>C# Programming Advanced</h2>
<span>In Ð°dvanced programming course I continued to develop my algorithmic thinking and I entered deeper into OOP programming. I learned new type of structures to collect data (Queue, Hashset, Stack, LinkedList, Multidimensional Arrays, JaggedArray). </span>
<h2>C# OOP Programming</h2>
<span>In OOP programming course I met new conception and programing approaches. I learned some new practis to make better code like SOLID principles, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Interfaces and Abstraction, Polymorphism, I learned how to test code with unit tests, some Design patterns and many usefull things like Reflection and Attributes.</span>
<h2>JavaScript Programming Advanced</h2>
<span>In this course, I saw how it works dynamically type language. I learned how to use different type data structures like (Object, Arrays and Nested Arrays ) on dynamic environment, learned how to manipulate DOM tree, to add event listeners and using them.</span>
<h2>JavaScript Programming Application</h2>
<span>This course teached me what is that CRUD operations, asynchronous programming on one thread, routing system, view in context of single page application. Step by step we builded front end part of SPA application from zero.</span>
<h2>C# Databases Basics</h2>
<span>With two words MSSQL Server. I learned SQL language, how to do Built-in Functions, Subqueries, Joins, Procedures, Triggers, Transactions. I learned what it means relations data base and level of normalizations of data base.</span>
<h2>C# Databases Advanced</h2>
<span>In this course I learned to use ORM tehnology Entity Framework Core (EF core) and two ways of approach to build data layer(code first and data base first aproach). In this module we were focus to create different relation data bases in every exercise. Mostly we used  code first approach. I expended my knowledge to use LINQ, met auto mapper and ADO.Net tools, learned to use data migrations, data transfer objects, serialize and deserialize data in to HML and JSON formats. In this course I also met  non-relational databases (NOSQL data base).</span>
<h2>C# Web Basics</h2>
<span>Next step in my education was very hard one - C# Web Basics. In this course we builded basics version on ASP.Net Core framework. We (When I write "we" I mean we like a course with mentor) started with basic TCP connection with listener, then added HTTP Request - HTTP Response model with routing system, introduced MVC pattern with data binding system for the views. During the course we use OOP prenciples like SOLID, encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, abstraction, some reflection and options to use attributes when it is necesery (mostly for autentication and data validation). 
<h2>ASP.Net Core</h2>
<span>This course introdused me how ASP.Net Core framework works. I learned how to create Razor Views and bainding data in it, how to manipulate request responce pipe line with middleware and filters, how to use Web IP and AJAX, Security, Identity, some useful tools like Signalar and Blazor pages, how to test code with unit, integration and selenium testing and many other things like sessions, cache, GDPR. In the end of the course I build project from zero and defended it. You can see my project here -> https://github.com/Sand82/BakeryProject .</span>
