<h1>Softuni</h1>
<span>Hello. Here on this repository you can find my solutions for the exercises on Softuni Softwear University, writed during my study on different technologist like( C#, JavaScrit, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap) and some small projects.</span>

<h2>C# Basics</h2>
<span>In this course I took the first steps in programming. I learned to work with for loops, while loops, nested loops and conditional operators.</span>
<h2>C# Programming Fundamentals</h2>
<span>In this course I level up my skills in the C# programming language, tooks my first step in OOP programing, learned to: work with some colections (Array, List, Dictionary, nested Dictionary), manipulate string whit regex and other operation like LINQ and loops and inproved my algoritmic thinkings.</span>
<h2>C# Programming Advanced</h2>
<span>In Ð°dvanced programming course I continued to develop my algorithmic thinking and I entered deeper into OOP programming. I learned new type of structures to collect data (Queue, Hashset, Stack, LinkedList, Multidimensional Arrays, JaggedArray). </span>
<h2>C# OOP Programming</h2>
<span>In OOP programming course I met new conception on programing approaching. I learned some prictis to make better code like SOLID principles, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Interfaces and Abstraction, Polymorphism, i learned how to test code with unit tests, some Design patterns and many usefull things like Reflection and Attributes.</span>
<h2>JavaScript Programming Advanced</h2>
<span>In this course, I saw how it works dynamically type language. I learned how to use different type collections like (Object, Arrays and Nested Arrays ) on dynamic environment, learned how to manipulate DOM tree, to add event listeners and using them.</span>
<h2>JavaScript Programming Application</h2>
<span>This course teached me what is that CRUD operations, asynchronous programming, routing system, view in context of single page application. Step by step we builded front end part of SPA application from zero.</span>
<h2>C# Databases Basics</h2>
<span>Whit two words MSSQL Server. I learned SQL language, how to do Built-in Functions, Subqueries, Joins, Procedures, Triggers, Transactions. I learned what is means relations data base and level of normalizations of data base.</span>
<h2>C# Databases Advanced</h2>
<span>In this course I lerned to use ORM tehnology Entity Framework Core (EF core) and two ways of aproach to build data layer(code first and data base first aproach). In this module we was focus to creat diferent relation data bases in every exercise. Mostly we used  code first aproach. I expended my knoweg to use LINQ, met auto mapper and ADO.Net tools, learned to use data migrations, data transfer objects, serialize and deserialize data in to HML and JSON formats. In this course I also met  non-relational databases (NOSQL data base).</span>
